    This project theme is "DETI memorabilia at the University of Aveiro". The aim is to develop a functional webstore with concealed vulnerabilities that are not apparent to casual users but can be exploited to compromise the system. As required, we present both a flawed and a corrected version of the shop, detailing how these vulnerabilities are explored and their impact.
