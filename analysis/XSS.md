# Analysis CWE-79: XSS

## Introduction
XSS attacks exploit vulnerabilities within Web interactions where an attacker performs indirect actions
against Web clients through a vulnerable Web application. The primary result is that some external code is
injected into the victimâ€™s web browser and will be executed. All existing context, including valid cookies, as
well as computational resources of the victim become available to the attacker.

## Vulnerabilities 

### Reflected XSS Attack

#### Example
We can search for products based on a url , i.e http://127.0.0.1:5000/products?minPrice=5&maxPrice=40&input=&category=Drinkware . 
But we can exploit this to do a reflected XSS attack , the field of category is rendered on the page by changing it we can inject unwanted code in the website.

This link, http://127.0.0.1:5000/products?minPrice=5&maxPrice=40&input=&category=Drinkware%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22Hellod%22)%3C/script%3E is compromised
when the page loads it shows and a popup saying "Hello".

#### Weak code

In this piece of code we assume that category is safe so it can be treated has html. ( templates/products.html )

Also on the function products() on Blueprints/shop.py we never validate if the category field is an existing one or if it just garbage.

#### Fix 

- If we omit the safe tag jinga2 ( our template engine ) will assume that the input is unsafe and only treat it has text.

- If we validate if the category exists we can on the server indicate correct steps to fix the problem.
